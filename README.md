# WellsFargo_Analytics_Challenge
My submission for the Wells Fargo Analytics Challenge, due 11/30/15

Consisting of 5 files;

1. Data_Filter_PreProc_Wells.R - This is all of the data tidying
2. ExploratoryAnalysis_Wells.R	- This is the creation of the corpus and the broad initial investigation including word-corpus correlation.
3. LDA_FirstModel_Development_Exploration.R - This was the first attempt at topic modeling. It was not great, so I dropped it.
4. STM_Model_Development_Exploration.R - This was my second attempt, and after iterative tuning, it is what I used for topics.
5. qdap_Sentiment_Correlations.R - This is the setiment analysis done on specific topics of interest.

Questions can be sent to sj13@stmarys-ca.edu.

Thanks to all the open source efforts of of everyone involved in R, but specifically;

- Kenton Russell for his work around the development of html_widgets for stmBrowser() and stmCorrViz().

- Ramnath Vaidyanathan for the creation of html_widgets.

- Yihui Xie for the creation of Knitr which allowed me to create the output in html
